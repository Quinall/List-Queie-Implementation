Singly Linked List in C++
This repository contains a simple implementation of a singly linked list in C++.

Description
The provided C++ code implements a singly linked list data structure along with basic operations such as insertion at the front and deletion from the front. It also includes functions to calculate the size of the list and print its contents.

Functions
void insert_front(slistEl *&list, int data): Inserts a new element with the given data at the front of the list.
void delete_front(slistEl *&list): Deletes the first element from the list.
int size(slistEl *p): Returns the number of elements in the list.
void print(slistEl *p): Prints the contents of the list.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable.
The program will generate a list of 20 random integers between 0 and 99, insert them into the list, print the list, delete all elements, and print the empty list.

Note
This code is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates a basic implementation of a singly linked list in C++.

Feel free to modify and extend the code according to your requirements.
